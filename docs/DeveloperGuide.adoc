By: `Team F11-B3`      Since: `Oct 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::sethomepage[]
=== Setting of homepage for a `Person`

The mechanism to set a homepage for a specified `Person` relies on `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`. +
It supports both the setting and resetting of a homepage. Resetting a homepage returns the homepage to the
default homepage of a Google search of the Person's full name. +
[NOTE]
Care is also given to make sure the homepage is changed when the name is edited if the current homepage is the default
homepage (i.e. not manually set).

[NOTE]
If the homepage has been set before, it will not change until it is reset by `h/` or a new homepage is manually set.


`AddCommand` and `EditCommand` both checks for the `h/` parameter that indicates whether the current homepage is to
be modified. +
If `h/` is parsed to be empty (`""` by `AddCommandParser` or `EditCommandParser`, a `Person` constructor is used to create
the person with the default homepage. +
If `h/` is a non-empty valid URL (determined by `Homepage.isValidHomepage`, a different `Person` constructor is invoked
to create a person with the set homepage. +
`AddCommandParser` code snippet to determine if user's `AddCommand` contains `h/` parameter:
[source,java]
----
if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_HOMEPAGE)) {
    Homepage homepage = ParserUtil.parseHomepage(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_HOMEPAGE)).get();
    person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, tagList, homepage);
} else {
    person = new Person(name, phone, email, address, tagList);
}
----

`EditCommand` will create an `EditPersonDescriptor` with the arguments entered, and pass the resulting
`EditPersonDescriptor` into a method to create the updated `Person`. +
`EditCommand.createEditedPerson` code snippet to check if homepage has been manually set before:
[source,java]
----
private static Person createEditedPerson(ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit, EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {
    Homepage originalHomepage = personToEdit.getHomepage();

    Homepage updatedHomepage = editPersonDescriptor.getHomepage().orElse(personToEdit.getHomepage());

    // ... other logic...

    if (updatedHomepage.value.equals(RESET_HOMEPAGE)) {
        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedTags);
    }
    if (personToEdit.isHomepageManuallySet() || !(originalHomepage.toString().equals(updatedHomepage.toString()))) {
        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedTags, updatedHomepage);
    } else {
        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedTags);
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of homepage changing when name of contact is changed +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Change homepage to a Google search of the name name when name is changed if homepage
has not been manually set prior +
*Pros:* Consistent behaviour - if name changes but the default homepage was still referring to the old name, user
will be confused. +
*Cons:* New developers will have to take note of the extra `Homepage` check when enhancing or refactoring `AddCommand` or
`EditCommand` +
*Alternative 2:* `Homepage` will not be changed after creation. +
*Pros:* Less complexity in the code, easier for new developers to handle. +
*Cons:* Results in a less user friendly application.
// end::sethomepage[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism
The sort mechanism is facilitated by the `SortCommand`, which is an `UndoableCommand`. +
`SortCommandParser` checks for the OPTIONAL `a` or `d` parameters, and calls the relevant `SortCommand`
to sort the `internalList` backing the address book.

The `internalList` is sorted using the full name of the contact using Java's `sort`. +
The following sequence diagrams shows how the sort mechanism works:

image::SortCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::sort[]

// tag::avatar[]
=== Avatar mechanism
==== Logic and Model implementation
The avatar mechanism is facilitated by the using `ImageView` in `JavaFX` to display the avatar in the UI. +
The main driver to create an `Avatar` is handled by `SetAvatarCommandParser`, which is invoked after `AddressBookParser`
parses the arguments provided by the user.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the setting of avatar is achieved:

image::SetAvatarCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::SetAvatarCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The arguments needed are `INDEX` and `AVATAR_URL`. +
An `Avatar` object is created using `AVATAR_URL` before being passed as a parameter into the creation of the `SetAvatarCommand`
object.

The `Avatar` class performs a series of validity checks to ensure the URL provided is valid. Validity is defined by having:

1. A valid URL OR is empty
2. The image must not be larger than 20KB (due to application slowdowns if the file is too big)


`SetAvatarCommand` also performs a series of checks in order to decide the steps to take before editing the `Person` referenced. +
Below is the code snippet of `SetAvatarCommand` for the various checks:

[source,java]
----
 public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
     // ... irrelevent logic ...

     // avatar refers to the avatar object created during the construction of SetAvatarCommand
     if ("".equals(avatar.path) && !"".equals(personToSetAvatarPath)) { // delete image from storage
            ProcessImageFromUrlToFileForAvatar.removeImageFromStorage(personToSetAvatarPath);
         } else {
             if (!"".equals(personToSetAvatarPath)) {   // has a previously set avatar, remove first before processing
                ProcessImageFromUrlToFileForAvatar.removeImageFromStorage(personToSetAvatarPath);
             }
         }
     }
 }
----
The utility class `ProcessImageFromUrlToFileForAvatar` is used to process images retrieved from the Internet. It contains
two methods -- `writeImageToFile(...)` and `removeImageFromStorage(...)` which stores the image into the
`DEFAULT_AVATAR_FILE_LOCATION` and removes the image respectively. +
Below is the code snippet of the write method:

[source,java]
----
void writeImageToFile(String path) {
    // ... irrelevant ...

    // Using hashCode() + checking if file exists assures uniqueness of name of created file
    File file = new File(DEFAULT_AVATAR_FILE_LOCATION + path.hashCode() + ".jpg");
    while (file.exists()) {
        file = new File(DEFAULT_AVATAR_FILE_LOCATION + (path.hashCode() + ++i) + ".jpg");
    }
    ImageIO.write(image, "jpg", file);
    return file.getPath().replace('\\', '/');
}
----

As `SetAvatarCommand` is an `UndoableCommand`, `removeImageFromStorage(...)` only deletes the image when the application exits,
in order to allow the user to undo the command. +
Below is the code snipper of the remove method:

[source,java]
----
void removeImageFromStorage(String path) {
    File file = new File(path);
    file.deleteOnExit();    // so as to allow undoable command
}
----

==== Storage implementation
`AvatarStorage` is called during `Model` initialization to check for the existence of an `avatar` folder.
If the folder does not exist, the folder will be created to store the avatar images. +
Below is the code snippet for the relevant code flow:

[source, java]
----
private Model initModelManager(Storage storage, UserPrefs userPrefs, AvatarStorage avatarStorage) {
    // ... other logic ...

    avatarDirectoryPath = userPrefs.getAvatarFileDirectoryPath();
    if (!new File(avatarDirectoryPath).exists()) {
        logger.info("Directory not found. Will be attempting to create new directory");
        avatarStorage.createDirectory(avatarDirectoryPath);
    }
    // ... other logic ...
}
----

==== Ui implementation
The `PersonCard` is updated via the `bindListeners()`. The loose sequence diagram is displayed below:

image::SetAvatarUISequenceDiagram.png[]

Below is a more in-depth look at `initImage()`:

[source, java]
----
/**
 * Binds the correct image to the person.
 * If url is "", default display picture will be assigned, else image from URL will be assigned
 */
private void initImage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    String path = person.getAvatar().toString();
    Image image;
    if (!"".equals(path)) {   // not default image
        File file = new File(path);
        image = new Image(file.toURI().toString());
        avatar.setImage(image);
        avatar.setFitHeight(90);
        avatar.setPreserveRatio(true);
        avatar.setCache(true);
    }
}
----
==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Saving of image from URL to local disk +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* File is saved during construction of `Avatar` in `SetAvatarCommand`, before the Avatar is set to a `Person` +
*Pros:* Filepath (not URL) of avatar class will be ascertained during binding to `editedPerson` +
*Cons:* New developers might find it hard to follow the sequence +
*Alternative 2:* Only save file after `Avatar` has been assigned to `Person`, assign URL as path when assigning before file is saved. +
*Pros:* Easier for developers to follow the sequence flow +
*Cons:* Possibility of program crashing (`NullPointerException`) if URL is added and Internet connection is disrupted before file creation is invoked. +

---
*Aspect:* Image source +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Only accept image URL from the Internet +
*Pros:* Easy for user to input source; Check guarantees validity of image from "HEAD" request +
*Cons:* Requires internet connection. +
*Alternative 2:* Accept images from user's local disk in addition from the Internet +
*Pros:* Natural extension of a function to set avatar. +
*Cons:* Difficult for user to input source; difficulty in writing code to ascertain if file entered is entered.

// end::avatar[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The find mechanism is facilitated by the `FindCommand`. `FindCommandParser` utilizes `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize arguments string and returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object that maps prefixes to their respective argument values whereby only the given prefixes (e.g. p/, e/) will be recognized in the arguments string. After which, `FindCommandParser` utilizes `arePrefixesPresent` method to retrieve the string which utilizes `ParserUtil` to check the validity of string expression.

Finally, `PersonContainsKeyWordsPredicate` will retrieve any matching string by the given command and prefixes residing in the address book in which `FindCommand` will execute and return the results base on the matched string.

The find mechanism support both `find` and `findany` command in which enables the search of single/multiple `Person` at once and lists their details (e.g. find john mary brook).

[NOTE]
If no prefixes are present, `find` command will search for the name of `Person` in the address book by default.
(e.g find [NAME]).

[NOTE]
`findany` command is able to search a portion of the `Person` details (e.g. `findany` ohn, returns a list of `Person` whose contains ohn. Result: John, Fohnny, Johnny).

`FindCommandParser` code snippet to determine if user's input contains any parameter:
[source,java]
----
if (arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_ADDRESS)) {

The following sequence diagram shows how the find (FindCommand) operation works:

image::FindCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of FindCommandParser +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Utilize ArgumentMultimap and ArgumentTokenizer to store all usable prefixes. Uses if-else statement to check if any prefixes are present when user execute the find operation. +
*Pros:* If user entered invalid command, the application will not crash but will instead return an invalid command message. +
*Cons:* New developers will have to take note to include new prefixes in ArgumentMultimap when adding new prefixes. Program will have to loop through if-else statement before determine which to execute. +
*Alternative 2:* Create multiple find command (e.g. findaddress, findphone) with different prefixes. +
*Pros:* Less complexity in the code and slightly quicker execution, easier for new developers to handle. New developers will not miss out certain prefixes to add in unlike Alternative 1. +
*Cons:* Duplicated find command with similar functionality which is unnecessary.

// end::find[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme mechanism

The theme mechanism is facilitated by the `ThemeCommand`. `ThemeCommandParser` checks for the input index `1` to `3`, validate through `ParserUtil` and calls the relevant `ThemeCommand` to switch the application `theme`.

`ThemeCommand` relies on `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` which is handled by `MainWindow` in allowing the application to set theme.

[NOTE]
By default if no index are present, theme command will return an invalid message.
(e.g theme "").

[NOTE]
When the application is first initialize, `BrowserPanel` will `.setOpacity` to 0% and when `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is triggered, `BrowserPanel` will `.setOpacity` to 100% (this is done to prevent `WebView` from displaying the default background color).

`ThemeCommand` code snippet to ensure input index is not more than the specified theme list and calls the relevant `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` handler to switch theme based on the input index:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    String[] themeList = {"NoTheme", "BlueTheme", "DarkTheme"};

    if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= themeList.length) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_THEME_INDEX);
    }

    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(targetIndex));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));
}
----

`ThemeCommandParser` code snippet to determine if user's input contains any index and returns message for invalid input or format:
[source,java]
----
try {
    Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
    return new ThemeCommand(index);
} catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
    throw new ParseException(
            String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ThemeCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
...
----

`ChangeThemeRequestEvent` code snippet that receive and convert the Index parse from `ThemeCommand` and set to integer targetIndex:
[source,java]
----
public final int targetIndex;

public ChangeThemeRequestEvent(Index targetIndex) {
    this.targetIndex = targetIndex.getOneBased();
}
----

`MainWindow` code snippet that handles `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` and call the method `setWindowTheme` to switch theme:
[source,java]
----
private void handleChangeThemeRequestEvent(ChangeThemeRequestEvent event) throws CommandException {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    setWindowTheme(event.targetIndex);
}
----

`setWindowTheme` method code snippet that check for file existence before clearing the current style and applying the newly selected style :
[source,java]
----
private void setWindowTheme(int targetIndex) throws CommandException  {
    String[] themeList = {"NoTheme", "BlueTheme", "DarkTheme"};
    String selectedTheme = new String();

    switch (targetIndex) {
    case 1:
        selectedTheme = themeList[0];
        break;
    case 2:
        selectedTheme = themeList[1];
        break;
    case 3:
        selectedTheme = themeList[2];
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    if (MainApp.class.getResource("/view/" + selectedTheme + ".css") == null) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_FILEPATH);
    }
    getRoot().getStylesheets().clear();
    getRoot().getStylesheets().add("/view/" + selectedTheme + ".css");
}
----

`BrowserPanel` code snippet to change the opacity of `WebView`:
[source,java]
----
public BrowserPanel() {
    ...
    browser.setOpacity(0);
}

private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    ...
    browser.setOpacity(100);
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the theme (ThemeCommand) operation works:

image::ThemeCommand.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the theme (ThemeCommandParser) operation works:

image::ThemeCommandParser.png[]


==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of ThemeCommand +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Utilizing `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` and allow `MainWindow` to handle the RequestEvent and call method to change application theme. +
*Pros:* ThemeCommand will have lesser responsibility and checks to validate (efficiency). +
*Cons:* There are other effective way in changing the application theme without the process of parsing and event handling whereby new programmer may find it difficult to understand the behavior. +
*Alternative 2:* Allow `MainWindow` at start to instantiate ThemeCommand and pass/set its `Region` to ThemeCommand, allowing accessibility from within. After which, utilize setTheme method in ThemeCommand to switch application theme. +
*Pros:* Straight forward, easier for new programmer to understand. +
*Cons:* There could be a breach in security as `ThemeCommand` should not be allowed to obtain `MainWindow` `Region` and hold it indefinitely.

// end::theme[]

<<<<<<< HEAD
// tag::recent[]
=== Recent command mechanism

`RecentCommand` uses a backing list from the `FindHistory` class to create predicates on which the `Model` will filter on and display to the user. +
`FindHistory` is implemented with a LinkedList which is updated when relevant commands change persons returned by `FindCommand`.

When `FindCommand` is invoked, the `LogicManager` adds the entired `FilteredList` into the LinkedList in `FindHistory`.

image::RecentCommandLogicManagerSequenceDiagram.png[]

When `EditCommand` is invoked, the `set` method in `FindHistory` is invoked to replace the old `Person` with the edited `Person`.

image::RecentCommandEditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The code snippet for the `set` method follows:
[source,java]
----
/**
* Changes {@code person} to {@code newPerson}
*/
public void set(ReadOnlyPerson person, ReadOnlyPerson newPerson) {
    if (userFindHistory.contains(person)) {
        userFindHistory.set(userFindHistory.indexOf(person), newPerson);
    }
}
----

When `DeleteCommand` is invoked, the `deletePerson` method in `FindHistory` is invoked to remove the person from the LinkedList.

image::RecentCommandDeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

A snapshot of the the LinkedList is also saved into `previousFindHistory` when an `UndoableCommand` is invoked, to preserve the
changes in the backing list.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Order of list view to show to user +
*Alternative 1:* Shows the list reverse order of persons returned by FindCommand (similar to HistoryCommand) +
*Pros:* Intuitive for user, better UX +
*Cons:* Requires an additional hook to `Model` to swap between two lists (addressbook and findhistory), additional complexity and chance of regressions +
*Alternative 2 (Current choice):* Shows the list in current order of addressbook backing list. +
*Pros:* Follows design logic of all commands that shows the list to user, allowing new developers to easily understand implementation +
*Cons:* Worse UX +
*Aspect:* Data structure to store `FindHistory` backing list +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* LinkedList +
*Pros:* Preserves order, fast add, able to use set to preserve ordering when mutating elements. Good for future implementations (if any) of
returning the list in order user searched for contacts.
*Cons:* Slightly slower than competition when traversing and deleting. +
*Alternative 2:* LinkedHashMap or LinkedHashSet +
*Pros:* Keeps order, faster than LinkedList +
*Cons:* Unable to use set, which is used when user edits a person.

// end::recent[]

// tag::gmap[]
=== Gmap mechanism

The gmap mechanism is facilitated by the `GmapCommand`. `GmapCommandParser` checks for input index and validate through `ParserUtil` and calls the relevant `GmapCommand` to search for `Person` address using Google Map.

`GmapCommand` relies on `MapToListRequestEvent` which is handled by `BrowserPanel` to call the appropriate method for loading `Person` address using Google Map.

[NOTE]
By default if no index are present, gmap command will return an invalid message.
(e.g gmap "").

[NOTE]
Events which triggers `PersonSideCardRequestEvent` handler, set the visibility of `Person` side panel card (Allow more display and exposure to the Web Browser).

`GmapCommand` code snippet to ensure input index is within the PersonList, and calls the relevant `MapToListRequestevent` handler to search `Person` address on Google Map:
[source,java]
----
try {
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new MapToListRequestEvent(lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased())));
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SELECT_PERSON_SUCCESS, targetIndex.getOneBased()));
}
----

`GmapCommandParser` code snippet to check if user's input contains any index and returns message if there exist invalid input:
[source,java]
----
public GmapCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    try {
        Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
        return new GmapCommand(index);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(
                String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, GmapCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
}
----

`BrowserPanel` code snippet that handle `MapToListRequestEvent` and load the method to search on Google Map:
[source,java]
----
private void loadPersonMap(ReadOnlyPerson targetPerson) {
    loadPage(GOOGLE_MAP_SEARCH_URL_PREFIX + targetPerson.getAddress().value
            .replaceAll(",", ""));
}
private void handlePersonPanelGmapChangedEvent(MapToListRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    loadPersonMap(event.targetPerson);
    browser.setOpacity(100);
}
----

`PersonSideCard` code snippet that handles `PersonSideCardRequestEvent` and set Person card side panel visibility:
[source,java]
----
private void showSidePanel(boolean isVisible) {
    getRoot().setManaged(isVisible);
    int opacityLevel;
    if (isVisible) {
        opacityLevel =  100;
    } else {
        opacityLevel = 0;
    }
    getRoot().setOpacity(opacityLevel);
}
@Subscribe
private void handlePersonSideCardPanelChangedEvent(PersonSideCardRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    showSidePanel(event.isVisible);
}
----

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of GmapCommand +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Utilizes event handler to call and load the person address on Google Map.  +
*Pros:* Better user experience. And ensures that the web browser won't be obstruct by `PersonSideCard` panel with another event handler that controls the visibility. +
*Cons:* We could always utilizes library and implement the `PersonSideCard` panel. +
*Alternative 2:* Load the person address on Google Map on `select` command.  +
*Pros:* Reduce the need of having extra command to load person address +
*Cons:* Only able to do one search feature using the web browser +

=== About mechanism

The about mechanism is facilitated by the `AboutCommand`.

`AboutCommand` relies on `ShowAboutRequestEvent` which is handled by `MainWindow` to call the appropriate method to load the `AboutWindow`.

`AboutCommand` code snippet that calls the relevant `ShowAboutRequestEvent` handler to open `AboutWindow`:
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowAboutRequestEvent());
        return new CommandResult(SHOWING_ABOUT_MESSAGE);
    }
----

`MainWindow` code snippet that handle `ShowAboutRequestEvent` and call the method to display `AboutWindow`:
[source,java]
----
@FXML
public void handleAbout() {
    AboutWindow aboutWindow = new AboutWindow();
    aboutWindow.show();
}
@Subscribe
private void handleShowAboutEvent(ShowAboutRequestEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    handleAbout();
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the (AboutCommand) operation works:

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of AboutCommand +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Utilizes event handler and ensure that method that open `AboutWindow` will be called.

// end::about[]

// tag::remark[]
=== Remark mechanism

The remark mechanism is facilitated by the `RemarkCommand` and `RemarkCommandParser`.

`RemarkCommandParser` utilizes `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize arguments string and returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object that maps the
 remark prefixes to its argument values.

`RemarkCommand` will then execute the UndoableCommand to update the person with the input string.

`RemarkCommand` code snippet that calls the relevant `UndoableCommand` and update the `Person` remark:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
    }
    ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
    Person editedPerson = new Person(personToEdit.getName(), personToEdit.getPhone(), personToEdit.getEmail(),
            personToEdit.getAddress(), remark, personToEdit.getAvatar(), personToEdit.getTags());
    try {
        model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);
    ...
}
----
`RemarkCommand` utilizes `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and `lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased()` to get the selection of
the person and add the string of remark to existing person via `model.updatePerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);`.

`RemarkCommandParser` code snippet that handle `ArgumentMultimap`, check if prefixes exist and get the input string:
[source,java]
----
public RemarkCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    requireNonNull(args);
    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
            ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_REMARK);
    Index index;
    try {
        index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argMultimap.getPreamble());
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, RemarkCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
    String remark = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_REMARK).orElse("");
    return new RemarkCommand(index, new Remark(remark));
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the (RemarkCommand) operation works:

image::RemarkCommand.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the (RemarkCommandParser) operation works:

image::RemarkCommandParser.png[]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Implementation of RemarkCommand +
*Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Utilize ArgumentMultimap and ArgumentTokenizer to set usable prefixes and get input string value. +
*Pros:* Allow user to add and set remark to contact anytime without the add parameter. +
*Cons:* User who wish to add remark during the `AddCommand` process will not be possible. +
*Alternative 2:* Include another prefixes that set remark for user during the `AddCommand` process +
*Pros:* New user can immediately give a person remark during the `AddCommand` phase. +
*Cons:* Can be troublesome for user to view their own input during the `AddCommand` phase as remark is usually lengthy.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.
+

+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
