=== Enhancement Added: Find/Findany feature with prefixes

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previous behaviour of find operation did not allow the user to search for other details except for their name.

This implementation now enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to utilizes different prefixes to search
for single/multiple contact details or a portion of details.

=== Enhancement Added: Theme

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previously, the application only support one theme which makes the address book looks dull and may not be suitable to be viewed by
user under certain circumstances (e.g. At certain time or day, user might opt for brighter look and feel on the address book)

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

=== Enhancement Added: Gmap

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=gmap]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previously, the application list its `Person` details using ListView. With the updated GUi, the person details will now be shown on
the left panel beside the web browser. Gmap command is hence added so that user is able to search for `Person` details other than selecting its homepage.
